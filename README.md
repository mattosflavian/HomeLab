# My Cybersecurity Home Lab

Welcome to my cybersecurity home lab repository! Here, I'll walk you through my hands-on home lab setup dedicated to cybersecurity experimentation and learning.

## Overview

This home lab is built to simulate a diverse network environment incorporating Windows 10, Windows Server 2019, Kali Linux, and Metasploitable machines interconnected via a pfSense firewall. The network architecture includes VLAN segmentation and specific configurations to mimic real-world scenarios.

## Setup

Refer to [Setup Guide](Documentation/Setup.md) for step-by-step instructions on setting up a similar home lab environment. It covers hardware requirements, virtualization software installation, and initial configurations.

## Configuration

### Virtual Machines
- Windows 10
- Windows Server 2019
- Kali Linux
- Metasploitable

### Network Configuration
- pfSense Firewall
- VLAN setup for segregation
- Modem-router-switch setup

Explore detailed configurations in [Configuration Details](Documentation/Configuration.md) and [Networking Setup](Documentation/Networking.md).

## Security Measures

Implemented security measures include:
- VLAN segregation for network isolation
- pfSense firewall rules for traffic filtering
- Specific configurations on individual machines for hardening

Find more about the security measures in [Security Measures](Documentation/Security%20Measures.md).
