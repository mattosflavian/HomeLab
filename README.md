### Network Configuration
- pfSense Firewall
- VLAN setup for segmentation
- All VMs NETWORK TAB were set to bridge mode.

## Security Measures

Implemented security measures include:
- VLAN segregation for network isolation
- pfSense firewall rules for traffic filtering
- Specific configurations on individual machines for hardening


## Conclusion

This home lab serves as an invaluable platform for honing my cybersecurity skills by practically experimenting with various operating systems, network configurations, and security measures.
